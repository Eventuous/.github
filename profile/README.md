## Hi there 👋

**Eventuous** aims to make Event Sourcing easier to implement.

Right now, we have versions for .NET (by Alexey) and Dart (by Kenneth). These versions aren't aligned, it's not really the same library.

How to get started:
- Check the sample app
- Read the [docs](https://eventuous.dev)

Don't hesitate to [sponsor](https://github.com/sponsors/Eventuous) our work!

<!--

**Here are some ideas to get you started:**

🙋‍♀️ A short introduction - what is your organization all about?
🌈 Contribution guidelines - how can the community get involved?
👩‍💻 Useful resources - where can the community find your docs? Is there anything else the community should know?
🍿 Fun facts - what does your team eat for breakfast?
🧙 Remember, you can do mighty things with the power of [Markdown](https://docs.github.com/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)
